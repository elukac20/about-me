# about me

I'm Elena, and I'm currently a computer science student at Barnard College. I have most experience using Java and Python for programming. 

I currently have no public projects, though if you would like to see my final project from the summer portion of Break Through Tech (in which we learned machine learning), please ask for access to the repository. If you are interested in the work I completed for courses, please ask me via the email I provided on my resume. There is no public access to these files to avoid publishing my solutions.



I have taken the following courses related to computer science:

- Introduction to Computer Science and Programming in Java
  
- Data Structures in Java
  
- Calculus I

  

I am currently taking the following courses:

- Advanced Programming (C, command line interface, Git)
  
- Calculus III
